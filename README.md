## 🌎 Mission
**Serve, guide, save, and protect humanity.**

SG QUANTUM SOS integrates:
✅ Eagle Eye (multi-layer surveillance)  
✅ Trinity AI (triple-consciousness reasoning)  
✅ Five-Elements Matrix (response coordination)  
✅ Quantum Neural Core (continuous learning)  

To provide early detection, deep analysis, and orchestrated responses that reduce loss of life during **natural calamities and man-made threats.**
